                    <span class="fw-600">In 1959 our grandfather, Abu Ali Sheik Theeb</span>, opened the first Hashem’s Nuts & Coffee Gallery in the southern Lebanese village of Bint Jbeil. Bo Ali provided the townspeople with fresh roasted nuts and coffee on a daily basis. Hand-mixed spices such as seven spice, kibbeh, and falafel were also made on-site and before long, people were coming from as far as Beirut for Bo Ali’s products.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-16 black-color">
                    Generations later, the Hashem family continues to provide quality products using the same authentic recipes and processes that were used to make amazing coffee, nuts, and spices in the past. Our coffee and nuts are roasted fresh daily to ensure maximum freshness. To this day we hand mix our spices and never buy any premixed products that may contain additives, fillers, or preservatives. Rest assured in knowing you are getting top-quality, authentic Middle Eastern products.
